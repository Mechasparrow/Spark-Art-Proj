Kara Walker\u2019s use of flat, black forms references the art of cut-paper silhouettes\u2014a popular hobby in 19th-century households. The pairing of this genteel art form with disturbing imagery produces a forceful picture that finds tension between the playful feeling of the silhouette and unsettling details found within.",

The reddish pumice would have been relatively easy to carve, so the minimal treatment suggests a deliberate and specific representation. The identity of the face remains a mystery; it is known to scholars as the Mask God. A few similar monuments exist, and small ceramic figurines with minimal faces are known. The abstraction of the face appealed to a 20th-century aesthetic; this piece was originally collected by Julius Carlebach, a dealer who also specialized in modern art.",

These figures are identifiable by a series of attributes or accessories. Herakles has his wooden club and lion skin, Apollo has his quiver of arrows, and Athena has her helmet.

Most staff weapons evolved from agricultural or everyday tools modified for military use and simply fastened to long wooden staves. All polearms required the use of both hands and were used exclusively on foot, except for the long spear called a lance, which was used from horseback. Staff weapons were used by commoners and professional soldiers in battle, by knights in armored sporting combats, and by bodyguards of royalty. Like many other arms, staff weapons assumed a primarily ceremonial role by the mid-17th century.",

The figures were placed there originally because their owner had died, or because they had lost their effectiveness in communicating with the spirits of ancestors. In the early 1950s the Ewa people who had been living in that region were decimated by disease and moved away from the caves. Some of the cave figures may be several hundred years old, whereas others appear to have been made more recently. Several long blade marks on the back of the leg suggest that this aripa figure was carved with steel tools, dating it after the 1880s. The caves were generally dry, but limestone in the water stained parts of this figure white.",

In 1920, it staged a production of Victor Hugo\u2019s Les Miserables starring Morita Kan\u2019ya, an actor whose repertoire spanned kabuki to Shakespeare. Yamamura Toyonari\u2019s dramatic image of Kan\u2019ya as Jean Valjean, poised to steal the bishop\u2019s silver candlesticks, is based on promotional photographs. These \u201cbromides\u201d had largely superseded woodblock prints as souvenirs of the theater. \n\nAs an emerging artist, Toyonari augmented his income by illustrating books and magazines. His first actor prints, published by Watanabe Sh\u014dzabur\u014d in 1916, attracted a circle of ardent supporters. With their patronage, Toyonari was able to establish a printmaking practice independent of Watanabe. This print belongs to a series of 12 actor portraits, his debut project as an autonomous printmaker.  \n",

          "Beckmann's diaries from Amsterdam recount his numerous visits to cabarets, theaters, and the circus. In this painting, an acrobat in the lofty heights of a circus tent is shown from an improbably close viewpoint. The acrobat crouches on a trapeze and seems to be waiting for the right moment to propel himself back for his next routine. Behind the sturdy figure, which nearly fills the canvas, a second trapeze artist appears in the upper right corner while an audience, suggested by dotted brushwork, fills the middle band of the painting. Beckmann's use of bold black outlines and saturated planes of canary yellow and lush turquoise heighten the scene's energy. To Beckmann, the acrobat's courageous performance evoked the challenges met by every human: \"We are all tightrope walkers,\" he said. \"We have the desire to achieve balance and to keep it.\"",

          "A configuration of 422 numbered black dots gives form to a face in this drawing. Most of the dots are clustered at the center of the page, while fourteen are interspersed, seemingly at random, over the otherwise unused portion of the paper. The drawing belongs to a series of photo-reproductions onto which the artist applied only the final dot, in this case #422. The 421 remaining dots have been photocopied from previous drawings in the series.  The artist said in 2005: \"I started with a little batch of dots, just enough to give shape to a face. I then began making copies, adding an additional numbered ink dot to each new copy. After multiple copies, the dots become blurry and the numbers disappear. The question materializes: What counts as an original? What counts as a copy?\"\"",

          "Album or friendship quilts were among the most beautiful and sophisticated American quilts produced in the nineteenth century. These quilts, made in Baltimore between 1846 and 1852, were stitched by groups of women to commemorate special events, to honor a prominent community member, or as a memento for someone relocating in this period of westward expansion. This quilt was made as a tribute to Elizabeth Morrison by a group of Methodist church women. It is inscribed, \"Presented to E Morrison By Ladies of Baltimore, MD.,\" and has eight signatures. Two other inscriptions begin with the words \"Friendship's Offering\" and \"Friendship's Gift.\" An additional message offers an insight into political events of the time: \"From one of the Rough & Ready/To the/Worthy President/Mary Ann Hudgins/1848.\" U.S. Army General Zachary Taylor, who became the nation's president in 1849, was known to his troops as \"Old Rough and Ready.\" The inspiration for the elaborate appliqu\u00e9d border on this quilt probably came from an imported chintz fabric.",
